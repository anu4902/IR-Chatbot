The project presents a comprehensive, end-to-end approach to exploring and querying the Hindu mythological epic, the Ramayana. With a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, the system efficiently retrieves relevant passages from a vector database and processes them through a language model to generate responsive, contextually accurate answers. 

Key Project Components

The project leverages several sophisticated retrieval techniques, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a FAISS retriever, and the LLAMA-2 language model. Each part of the process is orchestrated by the LangChain framework, creating a unified pipeline for efficient querying and response generation.
